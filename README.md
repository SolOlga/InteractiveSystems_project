# InteractiveSystems_project
This repo is for automatic summarization project that was done as part of Intelligent Interactive Systems course by Orfa Amir at Technion.

In this project we use the idea of metro maps data representation from (Shahaf et al., [2012](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dshahaf/fp0590-shahaf.pdf)) in order to build an automatic multi-document summarizer.
