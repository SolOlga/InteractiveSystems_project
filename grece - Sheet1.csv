1b,Greece Struggles to Stay Afloat as Debts Pile On,2009-12-11,"Ever since Greece’s credit rating was downgraded last week, its new Socialist government has fought back, saying it has the mettle to tackle the soaring deficit and structural woes that have earned it a reputation as the weak link in the Euro zone. “We will reduce the deficit, we will control the debt, and there will be no need for a bailout,” the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, said in an interview in his office here last week. “We are not Iceland, we are not Dubai.” But Mr. Papaconstantinou may have good reason for the traditional Greek metal worry beads he fingered during the interview. Outside his office, garbage was piled high in Syntagma Square, the result of a two-week strike by trash collectors. A student demonstration was advancing on the square a day after pensioners had taken to the streets. The previous week, protests for the first anniversary of the death of an Athenian teenager shot by the police turned violent, but did not cause as much damage as last year. Common in Greece even during better times, such protests are expected to increase dramatically once the government introduces austerity measures in its 2010 budget, including wage freezes and scaling back on public-sector hiring, which it says are needed to bring Greece’s finances under control. As Mr. Papaconstantinou suggested, the problem is not Greece’s alone — heavily indebted countries, including Ireland, Britain and Spain, are under pressure to show that they can stimulate growth and grapple with enormous debt burdens at the same time. Investors and European monetary officials are skeptical. Greece, in particular, has to transform a culture with a low tolerance for change and a high tolerance for protest, no easy task for a two-month-old Socialist government that says it is committed to sustaining social spending. Beyond convincing European Union leaders in Brussels, the new government has to win over Greece. The president of civil servants union ADEDY, Spyros Papaspyros, said his union was prepared to strike if cutbacks were unilateral and severe. “If funding cuts are made in critical sectors such as health or welfare, we create a serious risk of destabilization,” he said. The political and social challenges are intense. “It will be a very tall order for any country to pull off the fiscal rescue they’ve now got to pull off,” said Simon Tilford, the chief economist at the Centre for European Reform in London, a think tank. In light of Greece’s political challenges, he added, “I find it at this point difficult to see how Greece is going to manage this without some kind of fiscal crisis.” Certainly, the bond markets remain to be convinced that the government can avoid default. Yields on 2-year bonds soared to 3.09 percent from 1.9 percent this week — the worst for the markets here in more than a decade — while the 10-year bond rose to 5.3 percent from an already elevated 4.99 percent. In Germany, by contrast, a 10-year bond yields 3.2 percent, and a 2-year bond only 1.2 percent. The dire economic situation has prompted the question of what went wrong in a country that was once seen as the poster child for European Union membership and enjoyed 15 years of sustained growth, coming from behind to host the 2004 Olympics. “We didn’t use the Olympic spirit well,” said Elias Clis, a former Greek ambassador. “The previous government took the safe way, and the safe way is a very dangerous path.” After winning by a wide margin in October, the Socialist government of George Papandreou announced that the country’s budget deficit was 12.7 percent of the gross domestic product, more than four times the 3 percent ceiling set by European monetary union and twice as high as previous estimates. Mr. Papandreou last week estimated the national debt at $430 billion, calling it the worst crisis facing Greece in three decades and blaming his conservative predecessors for the economic state. Greece’s national debt is expected to rise above 110 percent of G.D.P. Last week, the ratings agency Fitch downgraded Greece’s credit rating on fears that its deficit might cause it to default, sending Greek shares plunging and making the markets jittery. Standard and Poor’s has said it will reserve judgment until it sees the plan the government is expected to announce in January. On Friday, Mr. Papandreou stressed the need for drastic measures. “We acknowledge the scale of the problem that we are faced with, and we are determined to make the shift toward a sustainable and healthy economy,” he told reporters in Brussels. He called for a “merciless crackdown on the corruption that is endemic in society and on widespread tax evasion.” Yet that is not expected to be easy. The underground economy, which some estimates place as high as 30 percent of G.D.P., helps citizens in countries like Greece with European prices but salaries below the European average. As he sat in a cafe with friends in the chic Kolonaki area on a recent afternoon, Antonis, 33, who would only disclose his first name, proudly announced that he refused to pay taxes. “Why should I pay?” he asked with a grin. “I don’t care about my government, I don’t care about my country,” he added, conceding, however that he did care about soccer and women. While not always so vehement, such views are common in Greece, where the government is widely seen as corrupt, regardless of who is in power. Indeed, few people expect much from the state — except highly coveted public sector jobs. Today, one in four Greek workers is employed by the state, a result of decades of public hiring to stave off social unrest. The Papandreou administration has said that in 2010 it will hire only one new state worker for every five who retire. But that, too, poses problems. Savas Robolis, a member of the main labor union GSEE who serves on a government committee on pension reform, called the pension situation “a ticking time bomb.” He said that Greece has only enough money to pay pensions for one more year. If the country does not replenish the pension funds, “Then we will face a huge social crisis in 10 years,” Mr. Robolis said. Fears of cutbacks are causing widespread anxiety. Lambrini, who has worked at the Health Ministry for 11 years and would give only her first name, said a possible freeze on her $1,300-a month salary was a real concern for her and her husband, a municipal worker. “We want to plan a family, but I don’t see how we can with such low incomes and with prices going up all the time,” she said. She said she had never joined a labor protest before but would take to the streets if her salary were frozen or cut. “I’ll be there,” she said. “And so will half the population.”"
1g,Infighting Adds to Merkel's Woes,2009-12-23,"Chancellor Angela Merkel will be glad when this year is over. After all the excitement two months ago of getting together her dream coalition of conservatives and the pro-business Free Democrats, there is now great disappointment. The coalition has squandered its time — squabbling. The Free Democrats want to quickly introduce lower taxes and reforms, while the conservatives are divided over the issue. As Germany faces its highest level of new debt in its postwar history, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble, a leading conservative politician, is the only one talking about a radical savings plan. Despite such a bleak prospect for Europe’s largest economy, the government pushed into law last Friday higher benefits for families and tax cuts worth €8.5 billion, or $1.2 trillion. They include big tax breaks for hotels. Mrs. Merkel may have miscalculated. These tax benefits are deeply unpopular with the public. Recent polls show that people want the debt brought under control and oppose tax cuts for a few sectors. So far, Mrs. Merkel has left it to Mr. Schäuble to explain the parlous state of Germany’s finances. She has not even mentioned the word savings, fearing a backlash from voters. Wolfgang Bosbach is a legislator and deputy leader of Mrs. Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party. He is also one of Mrs. Merkel’s most loyal supporters. But even he finds it difficult to praise the coalition’s record. “I must admit that the coalition has not functioned in any elegant way. Maybe expectations were too high.” Free Democrat legislators are just as critical about the infighting. Back in power after 11 years, the party does not want to be just an obedient junior partner. It wants to make its mark on economic reform policy. But it has been hampered by the squabbling. “What we have found out over the past few weeks is that we are not, after all, the ideal partners for each other,” said Otto Fricke, the party’s budget spokesman and a legislator. “We have not found a way to work with each other because both sides hold very different views about how to introduce reforms,” he added. There is little to boast about foreign policy, either. Mrs. Merkel had made climate change one of her major foreign policy themes when she was first elected in 2005, cajoling the Bush administration into taking the environment seriously. But her interest and influence both seem to have waned. Indeed, officials say she should have been in her element in the run-up to the Copenhagen summit meeting on climate change, which was widely seen as a failure. But instead of traveling to Brazil and China, delivering lively speeches on the issue or even promoting a clearer and louder European Union stance, Mrs. Merkel remained in Germany, saying little new. Even during the conference, she did not play any significant role. That was left up to the Danish hosts. “There is a real lack of leadership by Merkel,” said Gerhard Hirscher, political analyst at the conservative-affiliated Hanns Seidel Foundation in Munich. “There is a lack of ideas too. It is as if Mrs. Merkel has lost interest in foreign policy,” he added. Take Afghanistan, Germany’s biggest foreign policy headache. Over the past month, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the new conservative defense minister, has had to explain to a skeptical and pacifist public what exactly happened on the night of Sept. 4 in Kunduz, when a German commander on the ground called in NATO aircraft to bomb two tankers that had been hijacked by the Taliban. At first, Berlin officials did not want to admit to any civilian casualties. That changed after Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who is in charge of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, uncovered the truth: As many as 142 people, among them many civilians, were killed in the attack. Mrs. Merkel defended the action before Parliament — just weeks before the federal election in late September. Neither her conservative bloc nor the Social Democrats who were still in the government at the time wanted to make Afghanistan an election issue."
2b1o,E.U. Official Backs Greece's Deficit Cutting Plan,2010-02-02,"Greece’s deficit-cutting plan is ambitious but achievable, a top European Union official said Monday, while warning that Athens might have to take additional measures to shore up its finances. The European Commission is due to publish recommendations Wednesday on Greece’s austerity plan to reduce a double-digit budget deficit, which is a main reason Greek financial assets have suffered in the markets for weeks. Greece’s financial problems have also provoked talk about a possible bailout by the European Union and fears of a spill-over effect on other weak, heavily indebted countries in the euro zone. “What we are saying to the Greek authorities is, your stability program has established ambitious targets and objectives and we fully endorse these ambitious objectives,” said Joaquín Almunia, the E.U. commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. “The achievement of these objectives in the coming three years, before the end of 2012, is absolutely necessary. These objectives are achievable, but they are surrounded by risks.” Greece, which faces its biggest fiscal crisis in decades, pledged last month to reduce its budget shortfall to below 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009. The gap in its public finances has prompted a series of downgrades by rating agencies and unnerved financial markets worried that Athens may not be able to pay its debt obligations. Its debt is expected to reach 120 percent of G.D.P. this year. The Socialists, who came to power in October, have presented measures including higher taxes, a freeze on public-sector monthly wages of over €2,000, or about $2,800, and slower hiring. But the government is wary of cutting deeper, fearing public unrest. Unions have already called strikes for this month. A purchasing managers’ index of the manufacturing sector, released Monday, fell to an eight-month low in January, signaling no quick end to Greece’s first recession in 16 years. Greek G.D.P. is forecast to shrink 0.3 percent this year after a 1.2 percent contraction, government forecasts say. “The economic cycle in Greece lags that of the euro zone by at least six months,” said Nikos Magginas, an economist at the National Bank of Greece. “At the same time, the poor fiscal situation and the general sense of uncertainty created by market pressures on the servicing of Greece’s debt are weighing on business confidence and delaying investment decisions.” Reuters"
2o,Greek Civil Servants Strike Over Austerity Measures,2010-02-10,"Striking civil servants brought public services to a halt across Greece on Wednesday, in a largely peaceful one-day protest against the tough austerity measures officials have said are necessary to stave off a mounting financial crisis. Greece has been under intense pressure from other members of the European Union to cut its huge budget deficit and is in danger of failing to refinance some $28 billion in debt coming due in April and May. Fears of default in Greece and other struggling European countries have roiled financial markets around the world in recent weeks. But the Greek government’s proposals for deep spending cuts to rein in the deficit have met significant resistance. “We won’t pay for their crisis!” loudspeakers blared from Klafthmonos Square, otherwise known as “the square of the crying people,” where disenchanted Greek workers have come for centuries to express their discontent. “Not one euro to be sacrificed to the bankers!” In Greece, commentators said the economic problems had exposed a general ignorance about the harsh realities of the global economy, while laying bare the strong sense of entitlement in a country where one out of three Greeks is employed in a civil service that guarantees jobs for life. “People in other countries like Germany, France and the United States learned about the workings of the economy the hard way, by seeing their jobs on the line,” said Babis Papadimitriou, an economic analyst at the Skai radio and television group. “This hasn’t been the case in Greece.” But relatively modest public demonstrations Wednesday — one in the square and another nearby — were tinged with a sense of resignation that megaphones were no match for volatile financial markets. Indeed, even many of those protesting said they realized they needed to make sacrifices, or risk falling over what Prime Minister George Papandreou, a Socialist, called the “edge of the cliff” last week. Others expressed hope that the European Union would rescue their proud democracy from becoming the next Iceland. “We feel humiliated and we understand that things cannot remain the same as they were before,” said Vasiliki Revithi, 56, a biochemist at the National Organization for Medicines, noting that a monthly cut of about $950 to her salary would mean no new car and cheaper makeup. “But we gave the world democracy, and we expect the European Union to support us.” The crisis in Greece is a credibility test for the euro zone, the 16-nation bloc where a one-size-fits-all monetary policy has underlined the challenges of managing disparate economies during an economic downturn. Last week, the anxieties spread to Portugal and Spain, where investors increasingly fear that bloated budgets will not be slimmed. Late last year, Greece stunned investors by saying that its government deficit would be 12.7 percent of its gross domestic product, not the 3.7 percent the previous government had forecast earlier. The government of Mr. Papandreou appears determined, however belatedly, to challenge a national consensus in which the state has been expected to provide for its citizens from cradle to grave. “We are ready to take any necessary measures to make sure the deficit goal is met,” he said after meeting with the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, on Wednesday. The government has announced $2.75 billion in public spending cuts. It also aims to raise another $6.87 billion from new taxes and measures aimed at fighting tax evasion, which analysts said deprived the federal budget of $44.2 billion last year. It has frozen salaries, increased the average retirement age among men and women to 63 by 2015 and introducing a higher gas tax. While the changes have hardly been embraced, analysts said they believed that Wednesday’s strikes would not expand into widespread social unrest, provided that the government’s austerity measures produced results. The measures have been approved by the two main political parties. Passage appears certain in Parliament, where the Socialists hold more than half the seats. Yannis Stournaras, director of the Greek Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research, a leading economic analysis group, argued that a majority of Greeks realized that the future of the country was at stake. “Greeks would rather see their wages reduced for a few years than to lose their deposits at the bank,” he said. “No one wants for the country to commit suicide.” He also expressed cautious optimism that European Union leaders, who are to meet Thursday in Brussels to discuss Greece’s economic woes, would not allow the country to default because the credibility of the euro zone as a whole was at stake. “If the markets turn bad and deprive Greece of liquidity, we can end up with another Lehman Brothers in which the failure of a coordinated response led to collapse,” Mr. Stournaras said. “It will open a Pandora’s Box. The question is who would be next, a small country or a big country. If it’s a big country, then the euro will be in big trouble. I don’t believe European leaders will allow this to happen.” Analysts said that Mr. Papandreou was determined not to be the first Greek prime minister since World War II to bring the country to economic disaster. But whatever the political will, however, some economists cautioned that Greece remained at the mercy of investors. Michalis Massourakis, chief economist at a major bank in Athens, Alpha Bank, said the government’s austerity measures — and the tepid response from Brussels thus — had not been sufficiently swift to ease jittery investors. Noting that the government needed to balance the need for swift action with public sentiment, he added, “The government’s reforms have not kept up with the expectations of the market, because this is not something that can happen in a democracy.” A picture caption with an earlier version of this article misidentified people attending a rally as public sector employees."
2r,I.M.F. More Likely to Lead Efforts for Greek Aid,2010-03-23,"The International Monetary Fund seemed more likely to lead any rescue of Greece after diplomats on Monday struggled to avoid a rift among European Union leaders over aid to the heavily indebted country. Eric Vidal/Belga, via European Pressphoto Agency Jean-Claude Trichet, right, president of the European Central Bank, said there would be no direct bailout of Greece. European Union heads of state are to convene on Thursday in Brussels for a routine summit meeting, now certain to be dominated by discussion of how Europe would respond to the Greek debt crisis. But with Germany resisting any agreement that could be interpreted as a bailout, there appears to be growing acceptance that the I.M.F. will be involved in any new system for aiding Greece or any other euro zone country in financial distress. European Union officials acknowledge that there is little chance of agreeing on an aid package at the meeting on Thursday, though they hope to secure consensus on the system that would be called upon if the Greeks sought financial assistance. “We need a system in the next few days,” said one European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue. “The leaders cannot leave Brussels without some deal.” Greece has pressed European Union leaders to clarify what kind of aid they would offer to help the country refinance its debt at lower rates than the market is commanding. Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who leads the group of euro zone finance ministers, told a committee of the European Parliament on Monday that joining with the I.M.F. “would not be a scandal if the bilateral aid from the euro zone amounts to the larger share.” “I cannot ignore the fact that there are some reasons why the I.M.F. should be included in the solution, but it should be done on the basis of European rules,” he said. This month Mr. Juncker said there was no need for I.M.F. involvement beyond technical help. His change of heart reflects the difficulty of bringing Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, on board with a purely European solution. An agreement in principle, struck last week, that euro zone nations would offer bilateral loans if Greece needed them fell apart when Germany appeared to disown the deal, saying that a direct bailout might contravene European Union and German law. Last Friday, the European Commission president, José Manuel Barroso, called publicly for European leaders to strike a deal on aid to Greece, arguing that “we cannot prolong any further the current situation.” Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, reiterated on Monday that there was no need to discuss “emergency aid” at the meeting on Thursday because the Greeks have not asked for money, Reuters reported from Berlin. She appeared not to rule out discussing a rescue plan. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, also stressed that there would be no direct bailout of Greece. “We should not mix up subsidies or transfers with nonconcessional loans,” he said to the parliamentary committee in Brussels. “We can only be talking about loans without any subsidy element.” Mr. Trichet added that assistance would be made available only if there were a severe threat to the Greek economy and therefore to the euro zone. The fact that Greek borrowing costs were high would not be sufficient, he said."
3b2g,European Union Sets Deadline for Greece to Make Cuts,2010-02-16,"Greece faced increased pressure Tuesday over its use of complex financial instruments to mask its rising debt, with European officials demanding detailed explanations by the end of the week and saying they could extend their inquiry to other countries. Olivier Hoslet/European Pressphoto Agency Elena Salgado, the finance minister of Spain, with, from left, Olli Rehn, Michel Barnier, and Algirdas Semeta of the European Commission at a news conference in Brussels on Tuesday. The announcement came at the end of a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels, a gathering that threatened Athens with further austerity measures unless it proves within a month that its deficit reduction program is working. A crisis of confidence in the financial markets over Greece’s huge public deficit and high debt levels has prompted the biggest test for the European single currency since its inception. The finance ministers on Tuesday told Greece that it will have to show by March 16 that spending cuts it is planning can bring its deficit down from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product, to 8.7 percent this year. The ministers warned Athens — which already faces a wave of strikes — to ready itself for additional cuts in case a verification mission finds that the Greek austerity program is insufficient to achieve the targets set. Though E.U. leaders promised last week to take determined and coordinated action to defend the euro if necessary, there was no public discussion Tuesday on what form that could take. Ireland’s finance minister, Brian Lenihan, said that the 16 euro zone finance ministers had agreed “that we will not talk about what the instruments are. We believe that would be unwise.” On Tuesday, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn, moved forward a deadline for Athens to give its explanation of the use of sophisticated financial instruments that concealed the scale of the deficit. The use of such instruments was first reported in The New York Times. The deadline, which the European Commission said Monday night had been set for the end of the month, would be set for the end of this week, Mr. Rehn said. “It is clear that a profound investigation must be done on this matter,” he said, “and I will ensure that we conduct the inquiry so we see whether all the rules were respected.” He added that if it turned out that the use of the instruments was “not in line with the rules of the time, then of course we would need to take action,” including requesting information from other member states if necessary. Asked at a press conference if Spain, another heavily indebted E.U. state, had been approached by big investment banks with similar ideas about using derivatives, the Spanish economy minister, Elena Salgado, replied: “No, absolutely not, and if such a proposal had been made it would not have been accepted.” E.U. officials suspect that investment banks may have exploited loopholes in procedures for reporting debt and deficit figures, both of which are central criteria for euro membership. Mr Rehn said pointedly that “the banks themselves should also ask, not least after the financial crisis, if this has been in line with the code of ethics.” It remains unclear what, in addition to the measures already being taken against Greece, Mr. Rehn could do if the answers he gets from Athens are not to his liking. Greece is already facing action by the European Union over its excessive budget deficit, which far exceeds the limit of 3 percent of G.D.P. set by the treaty that established the euro. Greece also faces legal proceedings brought by the European Commission, the E.U. executive, over flaws in its statistical reporting. The use of complicated derivative swaps by Greece to mask its deficit was not reported to E.U. authorities or to the European Union statistical agency, Eurostat. “Eurostat made a methodological visit to Greece on 15-19 September 2008,” said Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for Mr. Rehn. “At the time the Greek authorities confirmed that, by law, government units could not enter into fictitious derivatives transactions.” On Monday the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, said that such swaps were legal when Greece used them. He added that they were no longer being used."
3g,Euro Unity: It's Germany That Matters,2010-03-09,"Ten years after the euro, it’s still all about Germany, which isn’t the way it was supposed to be. In the run-up to the common currency’s debut in 1999, the air was thick with talk about harnessing Germany’s economic power, then enshrined in the mark. A failure to move toward monetary union would lead only to “a preponderant influence of Germany,” Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, the former president of France, said in a 1997 interview in the French daily Le Monde. Now, as the European Union thrashes out a possible rescue plan for debt-stricken Greece, the importance of Germany has been thrown back into relief. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France can come out and pledge all the support to Greece he wants, but in the end, it’s Germany that matters. This isn’t just because it has Europe’s most powerful economy and its largest population. It is because Germany has proved to be a paragon of its own virtues: thrift and hard work. That can’t help but annoy its more profligate neighbors. It has been clear for weeks that if Greece is to get any help from Europe, it must persuade Germany first, which is why everyone keeps taking the German population’s temperature on the idea of a bailout. The response is overwhelmingly negative. One German magazine put the Greek statue Venus de Milo on its cover, with its middle finger up in the air, under a headline that said “Swindlers in the Euro Family.” This kind of hostile reaction has only convinced the Greeks that this crisis is a two-way tug-of-war. Greek politicians have called on Germany to pay compensation for its occupation during World War II. The Venus insult was matched in Athens by a mock-up of the charioteer on top of Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, this one waving a swastika. The Dutch, French, Italians and other Europeans don’t even get an effigy. Average Germans, who were the euro’s most reluctant converts, always had doubts about southern Europe’s big spenders. That has added a petulant “I-told-you-so” element to the political dilemma faced by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Germany’s fiscal situation suffered in the last year, just like everyone else’s. However, its deficit — now 3.3 percent of gross domestic product — is well below the deficits of Europe’s other large economies. With its visceral fear of debt, born during the inflation of the Weimar Republic, Germany took steps to reduce labor costs even before the fiscal crisis, at a time when wages in nearby countries were kept afloat by a debt-fueled boom. The German approach, helped by continuing demand for high-quality German industrial goods, has helped the country export more than it imports. According to Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistics agency, Germany’s trade surplus in the first 11 months of 2009 was €122.4 billion, or $166.6 billion, followed by the Netherlands in a distant second place, with €35.4 billion. That’s good news for Germany, less so for many of its E.U. neighbors, where almost two-thirds of Germany’s customers live. The tension of these relationships is what is making it so hard for the 16 members of the euro zone to come up with a system of joint economic governance. The danger is that the Greek crisis could stoke German disenchantment with any plan to more closely bind the European Union or the euro area. In his February outlook, Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citigroup, said this crisis could make the “umbilical attachment” of Germany’s political elite to the European Union “a thing of the past.” Yet unraveling existing links and institutions is virtually impossible, according to Jean-Dominique Giuliani, president of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a research center in Paris. “The interests of all the countries are too intertwined,” he said. So that leaves Germany to set the example. “There is really no alternative to the path Germany has taken,” Axel Weber, president of the Bundesbank — whom some see succeeding Jean-Claude Trichet as the president of the European Central Bank — is quoted as saying in “The Euro: The Politics of the New Global Currency,” by David Marsh. In other words, the Germans will be vindicated in their long-held view that for the euro to survive, other countries will have to be, well, more German."
3o,Greece Paralyzed by New Strike,2010-03-11,"Greek public transport was halted, flights grounded and state hospitals left with emergency staff only on Thursday as workers held yet another general strike to protest painful spending cuts. Debt-plagued Greece has faced a new wave of labor discontent since the Socialist government's harsh new austerity plan was introduced last week in an effort to trim its ballooning deficit and shore up the support of skeptical markets. Under intense pressure from the European Union to quickly show fiscal improvement, the government announced an additional euro4,8 billion ($65.33 billion) in savings through public sector salary cuts, hiring and pension freezes and consumer tax hikes. The cutbacks, added to a previous euro11.2 billion ($15.24 billion) austerity plan, seek to reduce the country's budget deficit from 12.7 percent of annual output to 8.7 percent this year. The long-term target is to bring overspending below the EU ceiling of 3 percent of GDP in 2012. The plan sparked a wave of strikes and protests from labor unions whose reaction to the initial austerity measures announced earlier this year had been muted. Thursday's strike, which shut down all public services and schools, left ferries tied up at port and suspended all news broadcasts for the day, was the second major walkout in a week. Hundreds of strikers gathered in central Athens ahead of demonstrations planned for later in the day. The government says the tough cuts are its only way to dig Greece out of a crisis that has hammered the common European currency and alarmed international markets -- grossly inflating the loan-dependent country's borrowing costs. But unions say ordinary Greeks are being called to pay a disproportionate price for past fiscal mismanagement. ''They are trying to make workers pay the price for this crisis,'' said Yiannis Panagopoulos, leader of Greece's largest union, the GSEE. ''These measures will not be effective and will throw the economy into deep freeze.'' Journalists, teachers, state hospital doctors and air traffic controllers are among those striking, while officers from the police, fire service and coast guard plan to join protest rallies. A general strike last Friday was marred by violence during a large protest march. Riot police used tear gas and baton charges against rock-throwing protesters, who smashed banks and storefronts, while left-wing protesters roughed up Panagopoulos as he was addressing a rally. The labor unrest could spark fears that the government will have trouble in implementing its new measures and translating its projected savings into reality. Greece insists it doesn't need a bailout, and its European partners are reluctant to fund one. But it has called for European and international support for its program, saying that unless it receives it and the cost for it to borrow on the market falls, it could appeal to the International Monetary Fund for help. On Wednesday night, Deputy Prime Minister Theodore Pangalos said Greece could bypass the costly process of borrowing from edgy markets by urging international institutions to buy its bonds at a set interest rate. ''We want, if there is an unjustified speculative attack against Greek bonds, to know that one of these institutions that have the substantial means to absorb such market products will come and say 'look here, I am buying Greek bonds at this price, with this interest rate,''' Pangalos told private Mega TV. He did not say which institutions he was referring to, or elaborate on the interest rate. Markets think some kind of rescue would be organized if default looms. Speculation has focused on possible guarantees for Greek bonds or help from state-owned banks. -------- Associated Press writer Nicholas Paphitis in Athens contributed to this report."
3r,I.M.F. Is Urged to Move Forward on Voting Changes,2010-04-24,"Officials from the United States, South Korea, Brazil and other nations urged fellow members of the International Monetary Fund on Saturday to move forward on a stalled measure to redistribute voting power within the organization. The I.M.F., which only a few years ago found itself defending its relevance, has assumed a new prominence and boosted its lending capacity since the global economic turmoil began in 2007. It extended loans of $2 billion to Latvia and $16 billion to Hungary in 2008, and is now expected to contribute as much as $20 billion to a bailout of debt-stricken Greece. The wealthiest nations have dominated I.M.F. decision-making since the body was founded in 1944, but voting power, which is based on a system of quotas, has not shifted much in recent decades, despite the rapid growth of economies in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere. At the fund’s spring meetings two years ago, the I.M.F. governing board approved a plan for substantial changes in the voting system. And last October, the Group of 20 countries endorsed a proposal to redistribute 5 percent of the organization’s voting power from the wealthiest countries toward emerging economies — like those of Brazil, Russia, India and China — and developing nations. For the 2008 plan to take effect, 112 countries representing at least 85 percent of total voting power need to accept it. But as of early March only 65 nations, representing about 70 percent of voting power, had signed on. “The goal is to achieve legitimate representation based on countries’ economic weight in the world,” Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a statement. “The current quota formula, however, falls short of this objective.” Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, was more blunt in a statement made on behalf of nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. “Legitimacy has to be the No. 1 issue on the institution’s agenda,” he said. “This should have been a core lesson from the crisis. Apparently, it was not clear or loud enough for all, as we keep seeing the issue being either delayed or pushed to the margins of the agenda.” Since 1944, the I.M.F. has been led by an official from Western Europe, and the World Bank by an official from the United States — an arrangement that is increasingly viewed as archaic. Yoon Jeung-Hyun, the South Korean finance minister, said on Saturday that the fact that nationality has been a factor in the selection of the top I.M.F. officials has had the effect of “undermining the legitimacy of their appointment and calling into question the fund’s preparedness to modernize.” He said he was speaking for 13 Asian and Pacific nations, including Australia and New Zealand. Representation was not the only concern at the I.M.F. spring meetings on this weekend. Mr. Geithner called for global coordination to speed economic recovery, overhaul financial regulations and combat terrorist financing and money laundering. Dominique Strauss-Kahn of France, the I.M.F.’s managing director, has expressed support for various reforms, particularly in financial regulation, and has endorsed the 5 percent shift in voting power. Greece’s finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, met here Saturday with Mr. Strauss-Kahn, Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the European Central Bank, and Olli Rehn, the European Union’s commissioner for economic and financial affairs. Mr. Geithner, who took part in the meetings, “encouraged them to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support” for Greece, the Treasury Department said in a statement. Also on Saturday, officials from Canada, Japan and the United States joined the World Bank’s president, Robert B. Zoellick, to call for a significant increase in foreign aid — currently estimated at less than $300 million a year — to combat malnutrition. Hunger causes the deaths of up to 3 million mothers and young children a year, they said."
4b,Digging Deep and Seeing Greece's Flaws,2010-04-29,"For Paul Koptides, who works in a car rental agency here, the news that Greece’s bonds had been reduced to junk status was just the latest in a series of blows, including wage cuts, new taxes and pressure from European neighbors for ever deeper austerity measures. But far from blaming the international community for failing to come up with a rescue package quickly, Mr. Koptides, like many Greeks, is taking a hard look at his own country these days. He sees far too much mismanagement and corruption. Greece’s shadow economy is the largest in the European Union. Bribing government officials is routine. And tax evasion is a national sport. “We did this to ourselves,” said Mr. Koptides, 37. “It is our problem. It’s not Germany or Europe’s fault. We did this to ourselves.” Greeks seem to be engaged in national soul-searching these days, wondering whether traits they once found amusing might have led to many of their difficulties now. Some say their country may have been unprepared to join the European Union in the first place. Some focus on how European Union funds sent to Greece were spent on wasteful projects. Greece’s last administration hid the extent of its debt. “There has always been this way of thinking in Greece that the thieves are the clever ones and the ones who don’t steal are the patsies,” said Petros Anagnostou, 46, a book dealer. “We have to develop a conscience as a community, to see ourselves as a collective society. If it is a jungle out there, then we will eat each other and end up in a place like we are today.” That introspection has not alleviated a sense of mounting crisis. The day’s newspapers on Wednesday carried huge headlines suggesting that the country was on the brink and that time was running out. A newspaper that is supportive of Prime Minister George A. Papandreou took aim at the European Union, saying it was going too slowly in extending a 30 billion euro loan (about $39 billion) to help Greece pay its bills. The dawdling has needlessly increased the intensity of the crisis, the editorial in the newspaper, Ta Nea, said. But most concentrated on internal Greek politics. The financial crisis has left many Greeks worried about what kind of a year they are heading into and where they can safely save their own money. Some like Costas Papadakis, an air force pilot taking the day off in Athens, said he was working on not panicking because that would only make things worse. He said he did not think the Germans had behaved well toward Greece. But he shrugged, saying he would have done the same thing in their position. “We will have to learn to pay taxes,” said Mr. Papadakis, 27, who was enjoying a frothy coffee at an outdoor cafe. “It will be all right. Other people do it.” The austerity measures have prompted a parade of protests, big and small, over the past few weeks, most of them by students and civil service workers objecting to wage reductions and tax increases. Many Greeks agree with the demonstrators’ sense of unfairness. They believe the burden of the new measures will be carried by the poor and the middle class, while the rich will continue to hide their assets offshore. But few Greeks expect much to come of the protests. “It is going to be a very tough few years,” Mr. Anagnostou said. “And the ones who did not pay their taxes, the ones who stole, have disappeared.” Vicki Apostolopoulou, 38, the manager at a costume jewelry store on a busy shopping street, said customers had stopped buying months ago. “They come in,” she said. “But they don’t open their wallets anymore.” Ms. Apostolopoulou said the fiscal crisis was the first subject of every conversation she had with her friends. “Basically, we should be angry with ourselves for this crisis,” she said. “But it is still a very scary time.”"
4g1r,Germany Now Says I.M.F. Should Rescue Greece,2010-03-19,"After weeks of backing a European rescue for the financially troubled Greece, Germany shifted course on Thursday, signaling that help should come from the International Monetary Fund rather than Greece’s neighbors. Virginia Mayo/Associated Press Prime Minister George Papandreou of Greece on Thursday in Brussels. He said he wanted to “borrow on reasonable terms.” Turning to the I.M.F. would represent a new and potentially humiliating twist in Greece’s financial drama, which was set off by doubts about Athens’s ability to borrow 53 billion euros this year to finance a yawning budget deficit and refinance waves of debt coming due. Worries that investors would shun Greek bonds and force a default shook markets worldwide last month but eased recently after Germany and other members of the European Union signaled they would come to Greece’s aid if necessary. The Greek government, in turn, unveiled a long-awaited package of budget cuts. But prospects for both European aid and domestic spending cuts seemed to fade Thursday with Berlin’s about-face, as well as a warning from Greece’s prime minister that the promised budget cuts might not be enacted unless the country could borrow at lower interest rates. “We will make it, provided that our country can borrow on reasonable terms,” Prime Minister George A. Papandreou said in a cabinet meeting that was broadcast in Greece. “Based on those conditions, our country is not seeking and will not seek financial aid, either from our European partners or from the I.M.F., which would be our last resort.” Despite Mr. Papandreou’s brave talk, it is likely that some form of aid will be needed to help Greece raise the 53 billion euros, which includes 20 billion euros that is needed in April and May alone. And for Greece, as well as the European Union, the maneuvers Thursday amount to fiscal brinksmanship. Greece would prefer that any financial help come from Europe, to avoid the embarrassment of turning to the I.M.F. But with voters in Germany and elsewhere strongly opposed to a bailout for what they see as a profligate government, European leaders want to see proof the Greek government is serious about cutting spending after years of living beyond its means. Citing legal hurdles, a government official in Berlin said on Thursday that Germany believed that any external financial support to Athens would best be provided by the I.M.F. “In the case that the Greeks get into really serious problems, we would support an I.M.F. solution,” said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. Beside unsettling the markets, Greece’s troubles have undermined the euro, the common currency it and 15 and other European nations share. Amid the uncertainty, the euro slipped against the dollar and was quoted at $1.3621 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday, down from $1.3741 early in the session. European stocks also wilted, with the Athens Stock Exchange General Index ending 3.4 percent lower. Since the euro’s inception in 1999, no member has sought support from the I.M.F., which typically comes to the rescue of emerging-market economies rather than developed countries. The earlier offer of support for Greece did calm markets and take the spotlight off Greece, but European leaders have been vague about how any aid package would actually be structured. The Greek government, however, has been pushing for more clarity on what its neighbors will do in the hope of bringing down its borrowing costs, which have risen as Greece’s debt troubles have become more acute. The yield on Greece’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose Thursday to 6.265 percent — a spread, or differential, of 3.14 percentage points over comparable German bonds, the European benchmark for safety. Germany says it believes that Athens can live with that premium, but the Greek government thinks it should not have to pay that much to borrow now that it has agreed to measures meant to cut its budget deficit to 8.7 percent of gross domestic product. Greece’s budget deficit hit 12.7 percent of G.D.P. last year, making it the worst gap in Europe. If Athens relies on financing from the markets at high interest rates, “that undermines the actual measures that you are taking,” Mr. Papandreou said. “That money then goes to the interest of those who are loaning to you rather than the implementation of a program.” The prime minister said that he still hoped for a positive response from Greece’s neighbors at a meeting of European Union leaders next week in Brussels. “We have kept all options open,” he said. Germany’s new stance could worsen divisions in Europe, since President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, both favor a European rescue effort rather than an I.M.F.-orchestrated one. Already, the varying announcements from Berlin have left some politicians in Europe cold. “I find what has happened, or rather what has not happened over the past few days and weeks, incomprehensible,” said Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and the current president of the Liberal Democratic bloc in the European Parliament. “It is incomprehensible because it is precisely a European response that is the quickest and least costly solution.” In Washington, Caroline Atkinson, the I.M.F.’s director of external relations, said on Thursday that the fund had not yet been approached by Athens. “We expect the euro-zone countries to want to and to plan to resolve this question by themselves,” Ms. Atkinson said. She added that the I.M.F. was ready to respond to a request from Greece for a loan."
4o,Greek Workers Protest Austerity Plan,2010-05-04,"Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Greece on Tuesday, unfurling banners over the Acropolis to rail against new austerity measures aimed at helping the debt-ridden country stave off economic disaster. Investors took fright across Europe and on Wall Street, sending the euro to a fresh one-year low. A leading indicator of European blue-chip stocks was off more than 3 percent by the end of the day, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2 percent in afternoon trading amid persistent worries that Europe's debt crisis would spread. At a news conference in Brussels, the Spanish prime minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, rejected the idea that his country - which is headed into a second year of recession with a soaring budget deficit and an unemployment rate of 20 percent - might also require a Greek-style bailout. ''That's something I would not give any credit to,'' Mr. Zapatero said. ''It is complete madness.'' But markets did not seem reassured. In Madrid, the IBEX 35 index fell 5.4 percent to close at 9,859.10 points. In Athens, the Athex composite index plunged 6.7 percent to 1,729.68. And in Portugal, whose fiscal position is also regarded as precarious, the PSI general index slid 3.8 percent to 2,485.43. ''There is a still a feeling of nervousness around the Greece rescue package and problems in the peripheral economies,'' Giles Watts, head of trading at City Index, told Reuters. Earlier in the day, dozens of protesters from the Communist Party broke the locks at the entrance to the Acropolis, the country's most famous tourist attraction, and hung banners saying: ''Peoples of Europe - Rise Up.'' The Socialist government of Prime Minister George Papandreou on Sunday announced belt-tightening measures intended to save ¤30 billion, or $39 billion, over the next three years. The plan is part of an effort to clear the way for a ¤110 billion rescue package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund aimed at preventing the country from defaulting on its debt. The measures, including freezes in public sector salaries, cuts in pensions and higher sales taxes, amount to a cultural revolution in the social contract between state and citizen. Public sector workers, including teachers and hospital employees, began striking Tuesday. A nationwide general strike planned for Wednesday aims to bring services like public transport to a halt across the country. Some analysts said the strikes could mark the beginning of a long hot summer of social unrest that threatened to unhinge desperately needed economic changes and could undermine the country's recovery by stifling growth. But thus far the demonstrations have been largely peaceful and muted by Greek standards, suggesting that a majority of Greeks are resigned to the fact that there is little choice other than to wait and endure David Jolly reported from Paris. James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels."
5g,U.K. Backs Germany's Effort to Support Euro,2010-05-21,"Setting the stage for another significant change to the European Union’s rule book, Britain suggested Friday that it need not block efforts to allow more sanctions against countries that break the euro’s rules, like Greece. David Cameron, Britain’s new prime minister, added however, that he would agree to such a move only as long as any change in the treaty would not transfer power from London to Brussels. Speaking in Berlin alongside Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is pushing for tough new punishments for straying nations, Mr. Cameron removed what could have been a hurdle to altering the treaty, which lays out E.U. rules. If Berlin gets its way, the European Union will embark on yet another effort to re-write its rule book just months after the introduction of the Lisbon Treaty, which was supposed to be the last such change for a decade. The talks came as Germany’s two houses of Parliament approved measures allowing the country to contribute to a nearly $1 trillion bailout aimed at stabilizing the euro and propping up European nations that are swimming in debt. By endorsing legislation that provides for loan guarantees of up to $184 billion, Germany offered a sign to jittery investors that Europe’s largest economy was committed to trying to solve the Continent’s debt crisis. Financial markets seemed to stabilize after the vote. The lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, approved the European bailout measure by a vote of 319 to 73, but 195 lawmakers abstained, signaling their displeasure with how Mrs. Merkel has handled a crisis that has tested the credibility of the euro. Later Friday, the Bundesrat, the upper house that is represented by the 16 German states, approved the package. Mrs. Merkel wants a treaty change to create legal certainty behind a new structure under which eurozone countries that exceed deficit and other economic ceilings can be stripped of E.U. subsidies or voting rights. Although Britain is outside the euro, all 27 members of the Union would have to agree to re-start the process of re-writing E.U. rules. On Friday Mr. Cameron made clear that his bottom line was that London not lose power to Brussels — something he has promised would trigger a referendum in Britain. “We don’t want to see a transfer of power from Westminster to Brussels,” he said. “If there was a treaty that proposed that, obviously it would be subject to a referendum, but we don’t believe that is going to happen — is likely to happen.” “Do we want the eurozone to be strong, to be stable, to sort out the issues and problems that it has and issues that it has so that there is good growth in all of Europe? Is that in our national interest? Of course it is and of course we understand the desire on the part of the German government to make sure that the eurozone works well.” Mrs. Merkel said that German ideas had been suggested “where a treaty change plays a certain role,” though she added that there was no agreement on that as yet. In Brussels, meanwhile, there were signs of early support for Germany’s push to punish countries that fail to balance their books. The E.U. president, Herman Van Rompuy, said at a news conference Friday that finance ministers had discussed the possibility of changing E.U. treaties as part of efforts to ensure budgetary discipline and greater convergence between E.U. economies. “Some people defended this standpoint, others would wish to reject it,” Mr. Van Rompuy said, referring to the question of whether treaty changes would be required. Even so, he encouraged governments to work “within the framework of the current treaties,” saying that would allow “more rapid progress.” At another news conference, the finance ministers of France and Germany, Christine Lagarde and Wolfgang Schäuble, also encouraged governments to use the existing rules to ensure speedy reforms. They were speaking after the first meeting of a task force that comprises officials from the European Commission and member states. It was formed this year by Mr. Van Rompuy with the aim of resolving the crisis in the euro-zone and to redraw rules governing the economic management of the bloc. James Kanter contributed from Brussels."
5o,"Greeks Take to the Streets, but Lacking Earlier Zea",2010-05-13,"As officials across Europe continued managing the effects of Greece’s debt crisis, Greeks returned to the streets of Athens Wednesday to protest pension system overhaul that will cut monthly payments, raise retirement ages and eliminate entitlements. On a balmy day in the capital, several thousand protesters gathered in Klafthmonos Square, known informally as the plaza of the crying civil servant, playing protest songs an chanting pro-worker slogans through a megaphone. Helen Skiada, a sales manager at a mobile phone company, was dejected by the smaller than expected turnout. But she said that Greece’s problems were so great, that people were losing the will to fight. She makes about €1,100 a month, or $1,400, and said she barely makes ends meet. She fears the crumbling economy will mean job cuts, including hers. “We have nothing to look forward to, but we also have no choice but to come out here and fight,” she said. “I’m going to keep coming out to things, even if I’m the only one here.” Another protester, Konstantinos Iliopoulos, who trains security guards, said that Greeks feel that a recession is inevitable and that more austerity measures lie ahead. “There’s a sense that nothing can be done, that the government will kill us with a thousand spending cuts,” he said The public sector workers’ union, Adedy, and its private-sector counterpart, GSEE, organized the demonstration to “send yet another message of disapproval to our politicians,” said Adedy’s president, Spyros Papaspyros. “First they cut our salaries, and now they want to cut pensions. It’s unjust that working people are shouldering such a burden. There have to be better ways to deal with our country’s problems.” The issue of pensions is crucial to Nicholas Nissidis, a math student who attended the protest. “I'll work until I die, because I have no other choice,” he said. He added that he was bitterly opposed to the pension cuts, which he said would leave him no safety net when he retires. This month, the Greek Parliament approved €24 billion in cost-cutting measures, including freezing public-sector salaries and raising taxes, in order to secure €120 billion in loans from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The I.M.F. had also asked for pension reform as a precondition for the loan. Greece received €5.5 billion from the I.M.F. on Wednesday and on Tuesday asked for €14.5 billion from the E.U. Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou has said that the country will be able to service its debt for the next few months. But markets remain jittery and so do Greeks, especially after a massive demonstration of more than 100,000 people May 5 turned deadly. A fringe group of angry young Greeks broke off from the largely peaceful protest and lobbed a petrol bomb into a bank, which caught fire. The flames suffocated three bank employees, and Prime Minister George Papandreou called their deaths “murder.” Around 65 percent of Greeks oppose the latest austerity measures, and 77 percent of them consider them unfair, according to a survey over the weekend by the Greek pollster Public Issue. Most said that special interests, not ordinary Greeks, will benefit from heavy E.U. and I.M.F. involvement in the country’s economic affairs. But Panos Tsakloglou, an economist who studies poverty and economic inequality issues at Athens University of Economics and Business, said that ultimately the wide-ranging reforms to Greece’s bloated public sector will increase competitiveness and productivity and create new jobs. Crucially, the changes to the Greek tax collection system will also mean that the country can recoup at least some of up to €24 billion lost annually to tax evasion, he said. The new pension bill, which will be debated in Parliament this week, is the most ambitious in generations and will stabilize Greece’s anachronistic and inefficient pension system in the long run, said George Pagoulatos, a political economist at Athens University of Economics and Business. Labor Minister Andreas Loverdos told SKAI, a private television channel, on Wednesday that, without these reforms, the government would run out of money to pay pensions altogether. But Greeks are, for the moment, focused on the short-term pain of this bill and the other austerity measures. “These are extremely harsh measures, there’s no way to overstate that,” Pagoulatos said. “People are not enjoying this, and they’re very angry at the political system that led to this collapse. It’s hard to be patient, to give up their wages and pensions, when they see there’s no justice.”"
